Implement Oracle + Futures Contract Dapp

Materials tailored to Ethereum + Nodejs but any Oracle-sourced Futures settlements welcome, platform-agnostic

Using OracleSkeleon.js, FuturesSkeleton.sol as reference connect a data provider( crypto exchange api for example) to a futures contract so that settlement is determined by oracle data

A frontend has been set up for binary futures testing here
https://github.com/zapproject/Hackathon-Armenia/tree/master/frontend

Feel free to provide expanded interface as needed.

Projects will be rated on performance, ingenuity, and scalable patterning

Serious bonuses for features like
    Novel interface
    SSL verification of oracle data
    Multiple data sources for oracles, fallback etc
    Oracle monetization
    ERC20 payments
    Futures contract factories
    Oracle data(crypto exchange, etc)
